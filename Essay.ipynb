    "There is a persistent debate over textbooks and whether they ought to be replaced with online materials and cutting-edge technological advancements. While some may argue that online materials are more efficient in terms of time and effectiveness for learners, from my point of view, advanced digital technology has also been harmed. To arrive at a sound conclusion, this essay will first explore the claims made by each side of the debate. \n",

    "Online resources are more useful and time-efficient for learners for a number of reasons. One of them is the ability to use their devices for internet browsing and lesson preparation at home. For instance, it's easier for the majority of people in the world to access information on the Google website with a single finger click. As a result, every institution that wants to assist its students with their studies must offer online services.\n",
    "\n",

First off, utilizing digital gadgets can be quite bad for young children's physical health. For instance, the radiation from cell phones and laptops that some youngsters are exposed to the latest generation of children is what causes their illnesses.\n",
    "\n",
    " As a result, it can be. The advantages, in my opinion, outweigh the drawbacks, despite the fact that there are strong reasons for both sides of the debate. As a result, I strongly urge governments to keep educating the public on the advantages and drawbacks of modern technology.\n"
